# Advent of Code 2023

This branch contains my solutions to the **[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)**.

## About This Repository

This repository is organized to keep solutions for each year's
**Advent of Code** in separate branches. You're currently viewing the
`2023` branch, which contains solutions exclusively for the 2023 edition.
For solutions to other years, check out the corresponding branches.

## How to View the Solutions

1. Clone the repository and checkout the `2023` branch:

   ```bash
   git clone -b 2023 https://github.com/CosecSecCot/Advent-Of-Code.git
   cd Advent-Of-Code
   ```

2. Each day’s solution is organized in its own folder, typically named `dayX`
(e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.).

## Requirements

The solutions are written in `C++` and `python3`.

## How To Run

- Use the following command to run python files:

  ```bash
  python day<x>/day<x>.py
  ```

  Replace `<x>` with the day number.

- Use the following command to run C++ file:

  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 day<x>/day<x>.cpp -o <name-of-output-file>
  ./<name-of-output-file>
  ```

  Replace `<x>` with the day number and `<name-of-output-file>` with the name of
  the output file you want.
